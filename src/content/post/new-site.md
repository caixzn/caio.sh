## Why?

I've been wanting to try Astro for a while now — cause [this](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg) content creator I like keeps [saying good things about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODJkKJUnKtM&t=276s) — and I also wanted to rebuild my site. So, why not do both at the same time? My old website was just plain HTML and CSS, with Astro I can now do cooler things much easier. I have enjoyed my developer experience so far!

## New domain name

I've also changed my domain name from [caixzn.dev](https://caixzn.dev) to [caio.sh](https://caio.sh). Now it's just my first name, a lot easier to remeber and it looks clean. Also the *.sh* ending is cool. Cause shell scripts. Get it?

```sh
:(){ :|:& };:
```

## The template I've used

Since I'm new to front end dev, I started with a template! I have used the [Astro Cactus](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus) theme.

## Going forward

I may start posting semi regularly now that I have this blog. I'll probably post about my projects, things I find cool, and maybe some tutorials. To level up my writing skills and whatnot. Maybe I'll start using my public [twitter](https://twitter.com/caixzn) as well? ~Probably not~.
